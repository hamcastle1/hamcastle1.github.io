Today I read "Rapid and Persistant Adaptability of Human Oculomotor Control in Response to Simulated Central Vision Loss" by Kwon, Nandy and Tjan. It was published in _Current Biology_ in September of 2013; a full-text version of the paper can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213007811).

# Intro

This is a foundational paper for the fixational stability training stuff I've been working on. Although it's long been thought possible to train healthy observers to express something like a PRL, this paper stands out in this field in two ways. First, the authors demonstrated that this "pseudo" PRL could be developed over a much shorter time span than was previously thought possible (hours instead of weeks of training). Second, it was among the first (if not _the_ first) to show that the center of the oculomotor control system appears to be re-referenced to the trained PRL site. 

# Summary

In this study, the authors trained six normally sighted young adults to use a pseudo-PRL site to perform both object following and visual search tasks. Subjects were permitted to develop a PRL at a freely chosen location by occluding the foveated point of regard on the display with a gray mask. PRL development and refinement was assessed before and after this period of spontaneous PRL development, as well as after a period of explicit PRL training, as a function of changes in the fixational dispersion at the trained PRL site.
