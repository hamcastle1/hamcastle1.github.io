Today I read "The preferred retinal locus in macular disease: Towards a consensus definition" by Crossland, Engel and Legge. It was published in _Retina_ in 2011. Again, paywalled, but a reference link is available here [here](http://journals.lww.com/retinajournal/Abstract/2011/11000/THE_PREFERRED_RETINAL_LOCUS_IN_MACULAR_DISEASE_.21.aspx).

# Intro

A preferred retinal locus, or PRL, is an important concept in the study of visual impairment. Many blinding diseases that affect the retina ultimately destroy the fovea, creating a central blind spot or scotoma. Over time, patients adapt to this change by seeming to select a region or regions in the periphery of their retina which they eventually use like a "pseudo-fovea"; these regions are PRLs. 

The difficulty with this concept is that although PRL _use_ has been observed since the earliest scientific studies of visual impairment, there is very little agreement or even explicit discussion of what a PRL _actually is_. This drove me mad both when I contacted this research at Schepens and when I first started at Northeastern. So, when I read today's paper, I felt understood as a scientist in a way I never have before.

# Summary

In this paper, the authors simply emailed thirty-eight authors whose work concerned PRLs in one form or another. They asked them a series of questions related to their working concepts of what a PRL really is. Their questions were:

	1). What is the definition of a Preferred Retinal Locus?
	2). What is the method for assessing a Preferred Retinal Locus?
	3). Can a Preferred Retinal Locus Be Defined in a Subject with an Artificial Scotoma?

Although there was significant variability in the survey participant's responses, the authors propose what they call a "consensus definition" of a PRL:

> One or more circumscribed regions of functioning retina, repeatedly aligned with a visual target for a specified task, that may also be used for attentional deployment and as the oculomotor reference.

Some issues (such as whether a person with an artificial scotoma could have a PRL) were sufficiently contentious that content related to them was excluded from this definition. 

# Critique

As I've already said, this paper was music to my ears. Too often in the behavioral sciences, we fail to stop and really consider the meaning of the concepts and terms we work with. Of greatest personal relevance was the question about artificial scotomas and PRLs: this is something I wrestle with daily. Although it is unnerving to think that 41% of the polled researches do not think such a thing is possible, it was wonderful to see the question stated so baldly (and to get any support at all, frankly). Obviously, the usual problems with qualitative research apply, but this was a cool first step towards addressing an important and under-considered research problem in this field.
