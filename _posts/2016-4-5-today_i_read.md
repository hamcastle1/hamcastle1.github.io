Today I read "Impact of Simulated Central Scotomas on Visual Search in Natural Scenes" by McIlreavy, Fisher and Bex. It was published in IOVS in September of 2012. An HTML version is available [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432450/).

# Intro

Missed a couple of days there x_X. Oh well -- best just to get back in the saddle. 

Diseases that damage or destroy the fovea have variable impacts on patients' bodies and functional vision. This makes it difficult to gather a standardized or homogenous pool of these individuals for research purposes. To that end, it's often more convenient to simulate the effects of such diseases than to go out and actually get patients. Today's paper uses a simulation to study what central field loss does to visual search performance under much more natural conditions than had, until that time, really been studied.

# Summary

The authors of today's paper simulated a central blind spot by using an eye tracking system to draw a blind spot over images of natural scenes. Subjects were asked to locate a randomly positioned spatial distortion within it. This significantly increased the time subjects spent searching for the target, and seemed also to increase the spread of points within individual fixations made during the task. There were otherwise no effects of the blindspot on task performance or eye movement characteristics.

# Critique

This paper represents a nice, if incrimental, advancement to our understanding the response of the visual system (and particularly the eye movement control system) to simulated central vision loss, particularly over the very short term. Of particular interest to me is the variability the authors observed in subject performance in terms of search times. Although it shouldn't be a surprise that some subjects would be better or worse than others for a particular task, what is surprising is that some were more or less _impaired_ by the presence of the blind spot. This is a kind of finding that comes up over and again in my own research and it's not something I've seen anyone try to address directly so far. Stay tuned...
