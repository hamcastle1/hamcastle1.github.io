# Intro

With this post, I'm starting a new block of work on this site. I've set a goal for myself to try read, summarize, and produce a short critique of a scientific paper every day for a year. We'll see how close to that goal I actually get X_X.

My second goal for this project is to practice a clear and concise scientific writing style, so both portions of each post (the summary and critique), will have length caps of five (short, at least by my standards) sentences each. 

So, today I read a paper by Nystrom et al called "The influence of calibration method and eye physiology on eyetracking data quality", which was published in Behavioral Research Methods in 2013. It can be found, in pdf format, at this [link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Holmqvist/publication/230811590_The_influence_of_calibration_method_and_eye_physiology_on_eyetracking_data_quality/links/54db17b10cf233119bc519af.pdf).

# Summary
This paper is a critical review of factors that contribute to the overall quality of eye tracking data. Data quality is vital for eye tracking studies, as they often demand tightly controlled relationships between eye behavior and stimulus behavior (such as for a gaze-contingent scotoma). Quality is considered in this paper in three ways: accuracy (how close to a known location a gaze sample is recorded as being), precision (how repeatable is a particular measurement of gaze position), and "quality" in the sense of the number "valid" or "plausible" samples are collected out of a total number available. The impact of calibration methods, stimulus properties, and subject/operator characteristics on each of these three metrics was modeled. Significant effects of all three considered classes of predictors were observed for all three quality metrics.

# Critique
I think this paper is a must-read for anyone doing eye tracking research. The impact of some of the subject characteristics considered, such as having blue eyes, obviously can't be mitigated in the lab. Other factors, such as the experience of the operator, have real and alarming impacts on the resultant  quality of the data. Specifically, operator experience positively predicted data quality on all three metrics. The authors concede that this effect was observed in what amounts to a little case study with a convenience sample, but maintain that it has important implications for training in the lab (and I'm inclinded to agree). Given the relative ease of use of most modern eye tracking systems, this paper is an excellent reminder that despite its low bar to entry, eye tracking should be used with caution and in a more carefully controlled environment than most labs typically use.
