Today I read "How effective is eccentric viewing training? A systematic literature review" by Gaffney, Margrain, Bunce and Binns. This paper was published in _Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics_ in 2014. It's paywalled, but at a reference link can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.12132/full).

# Intro

Most of my work at Northeastern so far has concerned eccentric viewing training. Roughly, this refers to the process of teaching someone to hold their eyes relatively still, with the center of their vision (what we call their fovea) pointed _away_ from the thing they want to look at (not what we normally do). They therefore end up looking at things with some other, peripheral part of the back of their eye (what we call the retina). 

This mostly needs to happen when someone develops retinal disease that damages or totally destroys their fovea. Typically this creates a central blind spot (what we call a scotoma). The scotoma obscures objects at the center of vision, so patients (whether consciously or unconsciously is unclear) learn to use a peripheral location on the retina to focus on objects. The degree to which this technique can be taught to or refined in patients through explicit practice is the subject of today's paper. 

# Summary

The authors have pooled the results of a large portion of the available literature on the trainability of eccentric viewing strategies. They also evaluated the "quality" of the design and execution of these studies in terms of recommendations for such systematic reviews set out in something called the ["Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions"](http://training.cochrane.org/handbook). 

They found that there are small-to-moderate sized effects (measured in terms of the usual trio of cutoffs for Cohen's _d_) of eccentric viewing training on "near visual acuity" (the exact meaning of this term is never explained). However, they also found that most of the available studies were plagued by design problems, including confounds with other forms of treatment such as visual aids and failure to appropriately blind experimenters to the conditions/subject group being tested.

# Critique

This paper is _depressing_. While there may really be some effect of training for some class of visual function described in this paper, the authors' choice of words and their failure or inability to produce a true meta-analytic outcome variable indexing changes in visual performance associated with training make this difficult to assess. What is more, their work seems to suggest that the quality of the available literature is very poor. This makes positioning one's research as response to perceived strengths/weaknesses in the field much more difficult. However, it was very useful both as a source of additional reading material and as a warning/reminder about the possibility of having similar design flaws creep into my own work...
