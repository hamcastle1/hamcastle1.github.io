Today I read a paper called "Perception via the Deviated Eye in Strabismus" by Economides et al. It was published in _Journal of Neuroscience_ in 2012. Reference link [here](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/30/10286.short)

# Intro

Today's paper is a bit of a departure from the topics covered in recent readings. Most of those have focused on eye movements or broader methodological issues. This one concerns another type of visual condition called strabismus. If you've ever been told you had or known someone who had a "turned" eye or a "squint", that is strabismus. Functionally/clinically speaking, it's important because it results in a misalignment or deviation of the optical axis of (usually) one eye. This, as we'll be discussing today, has lots of important consequences for the way someone would see the world. 

# Summary

Today's paper concerns a phenomenon associated with strabismus and other related conditions, called "suppression". Suppression is the "squelching" or "down-regulating" of signal from one eye when there's a misalignment or an image quality difference between the two -- this prevents someone from "seeing double" (what we call diplopia). The authors of today's paper investigated the extent to which stimuli shown to the deviated eye -- which should be suppressed and thus not visible -- can still be perceived. They did this by showing subjects targets a purple target on a field while they wore a pair of red/blue 3-D glasses, and asked them what color it was. The reported "blueness" or "redness" of the target therefore corresponded to the eye in which it was perceived. They found that subjects did indeed perceive targets in the fovea of the deviated eye, but that the apparent position of the target was shifted by a factor equal to that of the deviation in the strabismic eye (??!)

# Critique

This is an interesting paper, and involves a cool use of (simple) 3-D vision technology to try and parse information flow to each eye individually. It also produces some absolutely beautiful plots:

Still not sure I'm 100% clear on the implication of the finding related the change in perceived position -- maybe I didn't read carefully enough, but my thought was that the task was simply to report the color, not to also report the location of the target...
