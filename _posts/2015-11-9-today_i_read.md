Today I read "Defending Yarbus: Eye movements reveal observers' task" by Ali Borji and Laurent Itti. This paper was published in *Journal of Vision* in 2014 as part of Volume 14, Issue 3.

**Summary:**

This paper was written largely in response to one published by Greene et al (2012; I'll review this paper in a subsequent study) that produced a negative result with respect to Yarbus' original observation (1967)

related research and cognitive psychology. Obviously, the ability to infer an observer's goals or mental state on the basis of their eye movement trace would have huge scientific and technical implications -- hence
the large volume of work in this area. Most related research has focused on attempts to estimate
