title: About Me

Hello! I'm Dylan Rose. Here is a silly picture of me:

![Test.](/assets/silly_picture.jpg){: .center-image }

Currently, I'm a PhD student in Peter Bex's Translational Vision Laboratory at Northeastern University. I'm interested in a couple of biggish research areas:

1. Developing methods to enhance oculomotor control in complex environments for individuals with:
   * Central visual field loss.
   * Various "opsias" (disease states that produce blindness in portions of the visual field).
2. The use of eye movement data, in conjunction with image processing and machine learning methods, to perform biometric tasks, such as:
   * Ophthalmological and neuropsychological disease detection.
   * Behavior/user identification.

This is page serves partly as a point of contact for those looking to get in touch with me, partly as a place to host copies of my academic work, partly as a place to record my academic and technical reading, and partly as a place to document various extra-curricular data/visualization projects.
