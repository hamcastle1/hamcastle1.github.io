## Who the hell are you!?
Dylan Rose! I'm a PhD student in Peter Bex's Translational Vision Laboratory at Northeastern University.

Here is a silly picture of me from a long time ago:

![Test.](/assets/silly_picture.jpg){: .center-image }

It was a simpler time.

## What on Earth could someone with such a dumb haircut possibly spend his days doing!?
At the moment, I'm doing research in a couple of areas:

1. Developing methods to enhance oculomotor control in/improve information gathering from complex environments for individuals with:
   * Central visual field loss.
   * Various "-opsias" (disease states that produce blindness in portions of the visual field).
2. The use of eye movement data, in conjunction with image processing and machine learning methods, to perform biometric tasks, such as:
   * Ophthalmological and neuropsychological disease detection.
   * Behavior/user identification.

## Why on Earth does this page exist!?
In order to serve as:

 1. a point of contact for those looking to get in touch with me for various reasons.
 2. a place to host copies of my academic work.
 3. a place to record the progress of my academic and technical reading.
 4. and a place to document various extra-curricular hardware/data/visualization projects.

## I got beef! How do I let you know!?
Well, iff you have something nice/interesting to say, perhaps wish to collaborate on a data-related project, or are looking to get in touch about something related to my academic work, you can reach me at:

   * <rose.dy@husky.neu.edu>

Otherwise, be warned: my spam-filter game is *on point.*
