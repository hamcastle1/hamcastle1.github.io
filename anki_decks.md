As a graduate student, I'm mostly past the point in my education where I have to do a lot of memorization. Recently, though, a couple of things have cropped up where I felt it might be important to commit some sh*t to memory.

To this end I've been using [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) to build flashcard decks, and by glob is it impressive. Run, don't walk, if you need to do some hardcore memorization-based studying. 

One of Anki's best features is its ability to generate decks of cards from input in a variety of forms, including both .CSV files and its own proprietary file format. This means there is also a nice community of users out there who have shared decks for various purposes. 

What follows are my own small contributions to this pool of resources. Currently, I have completed/in progress decks for:

- [Think Python]({{ site.url }}/assets/think_python_decks.zip) -- Allen Downey's excellent introduction to the Python programming language and to CS more broadly (currently completely through Chapter 2).
- [Omnifocus 2 Keyboard Shortcuts]({{ site.url }}/assets/omnifocus_keyboard_shorcuts.zip) -- self explanatory (complete).

This list, and the decks themselves, will get updated periodically as I go. I've included both the .apkg files and the .CSVs I used to generate them originally. 

Bon appetit!
